# WORK_DIR       scratch space for intermediate rasters, about 2.5 GB

# PYTHON picks the interpreter. It needs numpy, scipy, Pillow and, for the cone model, PyChrono.
# Peak memory is about 15 GB, in the shadow step. The whole run takes 19 minutes on five cores of an M4 Pro.
# SPEEDWAY_CORES sets how many cores the photo steps use (default: all, up to 12). The result does not depend on it.
# Every step is seeded, so the same scan and reference data give the same archive, byte for byte.
