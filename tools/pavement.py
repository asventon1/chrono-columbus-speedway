"""Where the pavement is: a clean map of hard surface against everything else.

The photo decides wherever it can see the ground: concrete, asphalt and gravel have almost no
colour, grass and crops and water do. Where a tree's crown hides the ground the photo cannot
say, so a road is carried across the gap when there is pavement at both ends of a straight line
through it and nothing but canopy in between.

The result is kept as a signed distance to the pavement's edge, in metres, positive on the
pavement. The ground mesh is cut along its zero line.
