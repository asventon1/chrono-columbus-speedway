"""Road paint as geometry: each painted line a flat ribbon laid on the pavement.

In the ground's photo a lane line is two texels wide, and seen from a car, at a shallow angle,
texture filtering smears it into the concrete. So the paint is taken out of the photo and drawn
as its own mesh instead, a couple of centimetres above the road, where it stays sharp at any
distance. markings.py finds the paint as strokes: a centre line, a width and a colour.

One mesh per colour, in scene coordinates. Metres, Z up.
