"""Find the traffic cones the drone photographed, so they can be painted out and stood back up.

A cone is a small patch of strong, unnatural colour on pavement: lime green or orange where
concrete has almost no colour at all. The scan flattened each one into a smear a few tens of
centimetres across, but left its shadow on the pavement beside it. The patch says where the
cone stood and what colour it was. The length of the shadow says how tall it was.
