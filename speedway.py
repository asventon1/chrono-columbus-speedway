"""Drive an Audi around Columbus 151 Speedway, a vehicle test track in Wisconsin, in PyChrono.

    conda install projectchrono::pychrono -c conda-forge    # once, from the projectchrono channel
    python speedway.py

The first run downloads the scene into scene/ beside this file and checks its hash. After that
it starts straight away. Nothing is converted and Chrono is not modified: this needs only a
stock PyChrono with the vehicle and VSG modules.

Controls: hold W to accelerate and S to brake, hold A or D to steer. Let go and the car coasts
and the wheel centres, as in a driving game. Chrono cannot tell when a key is let go, so this
reads the keyboard from X11 and needs an X11 desktop. --keys step gives Chrono's own behaviour,
where each press nudges an input and it stays there, and is what you get without X11.

To put the track in a simulation of your own, import this file:

    import speedway
    scene = speedway.fetch()                      # scene directory, downloaded if it is not there
    speedway.add_scenery(system, scene)           # what you see: visual shapes, no collision
    terrain = speedway.add_ground(system, scene)  # what the wheels touch: one collision mesh
    z = speedway.ground_height(scene, x, y)       # ground height, usable before the first step

The ground is the USGS 3DEP lidar survey of the site. Its picture, and where the trees and
buildings stand, come from a drone scan. See the README for how they were put together.
